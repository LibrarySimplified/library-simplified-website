<meta name="About" content="With the help of this Institute of Museum and Library Services, ten public libraries across the United States are exploring that question. We’re re-thinking traditional library policies and building new technology to make the libraries and their digital collections easier to access. Our goal is to break down barriers to library use so that more people take advantage of all the services that the library offers. We hope you’ll join the conversation." />

				<strong> Summary </strong>IMLS funding will support the expansion of NYPL’s team of e-book developers to accelerate the development of additional features, migrate the app to additional platforms, create a public domain library with remediated meta-data and cover art, and complete the initial planning, scoping, and scaffolding of a proposed nonprofit content exchange. Funding will also support convening and community-building activities led by project partner DPLA in collaboration with NYPL staff for the duration of the project period, especially NYPL’s grant-funded Open Source Community Organizer in Year 2.

			<div class="well">
				<strong>LEAP’s four primary deliverables are: </strong>
				<ol>
					<li>a fully developed, functional Library Simplified e-content reader application, available on several platforms; </li>
					<li>a remediated public domain library of ebooks that can be served through Library Simplified or other existing interfaces; </li>
					<li> the critical technology components needed to support the first year of Open eBooks including customization of the Library Simplified application so that it can be configured to support users of the Open eBooks collection. </li>

Stacy Kinney, a Librarian and Media Specialist at O.A. Fleming Elementary in Freeport, TX, used Open eBooks to “put otherwise costly books into the hands of our children.” Stacy’s school is a Title One campus. “I value the Open eBook app because it makes quality, appealing books accessible to my students and their families.”
