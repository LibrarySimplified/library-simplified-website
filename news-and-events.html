				<h5>Amigos Receives Texas Grant for SimplyE</h5>
				<p>
					On August 7, 2017, Amigos Library Services was notified that their proposal submitted for the Texas State Library & Archives Commission Cooperation Grant was accepted. Funding from this grant will support their work in assisting public libraries interested in implementing the SimplyE app.</p>
					<p>
					SimplyE is an open source ereading platform developed by libraries for libraries.  In short, it simplifies your library users experience finding, borrowing and reading an ebook from the library. Developed using ReadersFirst principles, it makes borrowing ebooks from a library easy and quick, hiding the DRM frustrations from the patron.</p>
					<p>Amigos had already received funding from the Arizona State Library, Archives & Public Records to begin work on the technical infrastructure necessary to support public libraries. This grant from the Texas State Library & Archives Commission gives Amigos Library Services the ability to create a stable service for not only our members, but other libraries interested in the app, but without the technical resources to implement the app themselves.</p>
					<p>Christine Peterson will be scheduling webinars focused on the functionality and development of the app in the fall. Watch for these to be announced through our Amigos Now newsletter. If you are interested in helping with this project, contact Christine at peterson@amigos.org or 800-843-8482, ext. 2891.</p>

				<h5>Thanks, Bibliotheca:  We Can’t Do It Without You!</h5>
				<p>
					We are always delighted to report when a publisher or library vendor steps forward to make the library e-content experience even better.  With profound thanks, then, we give a shout out to Tom Mercer of Cloud Library (Bibliotheca). Tom has been very supportive of SimplyE which as since been adopted by NYPL, Brooklyn Public Library, and will be coming soon to the states of Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, the multi-state network of Minitex, and huge swaths of California and Texas.  When approached about an important development in the app—how to serve audiobook content from Cloud Library--Tom Mercer came to NYPL and brought his expert cadre of folks so they could understand what SimplyE is proposing and how they could be of support. A big thanks, too, to Findaway, a third party service provider of audiobook content for both Bibliotheca and Baker & Taylor.  Ralph Lazaro, Findaway VP of Digital Products, joined Tom to learn more and see how they could support this advance. Not only was this visit and discussion promising, but Bibliotheca, working with Findaway, have responded with prompt action, extending their APIs and providing engineering support to SimplyE. We are that much closer to integrating e-audio into the app, allowing a full range of content from many library vendors into a single app, simplifying and improving the experience for libraries and their users.</p>
					<p> Equally supportive are Michael Bills and Livia Bitner of Baker & Taylor, who have been receptive to SimplyE and highly supportive in related SimplyE efforts like Open eBooks.  We look forward to Baker & Taylor taking action soon. Thanks, as well, to Recorded Books for making RB Digital audiobook content work with the app, while supporting Connecticut’s related eGO platform. Tom, Ralph, Bibliotheca, and Findaway - a tip of our library hat to you for Finding-A-Way to move forward, and putting the Reader (and Listener) First! Libraries rely upon partnerships with vendors to enhance service with us, and you have won today.</p>

				<p>
					A big shout out to Mitchell Davis and his team at BiblioLabs.   As consortia and state libraries began planning their implementations of SimplyE, many wondered what they would do with their Biblioboard platform investment.  As usual Mitchell and his team were eager to explore how they could help improve the eBook user experience for ebook readers using libraries. The BiblioLabs team stepped up to make the integration of their collections part of the mainstream catalog of e-content available in SimplyE by publishing their catalog using their Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) protocol which SimplyE is built on.  On behalf of the libraries around the country looking to improve their ebooks users experience and library ebook services with SimplyE, thank you Mitchell and the rest of the Biblioboard team for continuing to invest in the future of libraries.</p>

				<p>
					For riders of the subway in New York City, they now can enjoy free ebooks from the library for a limited time.  As part of a collaboration between the MTA, MTA Wireless and New York's City's public libraries, riders were introduced to MTA's system wide Wi Fi service with a free library of books they could read on their daily commute.  The limited time service was also a debut of the the SimplyE Web reader which supports offline reading of EPUBs in a user's mobile or pc web browser.  For those who enjoyed reading free books on the subway they were also invited to download the mobile app for their iOS or Android device so they could access even more titles.  If just visiting the city they could still download the app and access a large collection of books free for anyone to read.</br>
					It is now easier than ever to take the Library with you, whether you're at home, on your commute, or enjoying the summer at the beach. You can download the the initial release of SimplyE for iPhone/iPad or Android, login with your library card credentials, and start reading.

				<h5>We have a new logo and so much more! </h5>
				<p>
					SimplyE, the library ereading app, just released version 2.0 which not only sports a new logo, but a collection of free for anyone to read books called The SimplyE Collection.  This collection of classics is expected to grow over time to include more contemporary works as well as excerpts, short stories and more. You don't need a library card to read them either.  But if you do have a library card, stay tuned.  SimplyE 2.0 is a multi-library app which allows users to add other libraries to the app if they belong to more than one library or who have access to shared collections from their state or library consortia.  For example, New Yorkers who have a Brooklyn Public Library card can now access their rich collection of ebooks as well in SimplyE.  </br>

With the help of our wonderful partners at NYPL, the National Book Foundation, the Digital Public Library of America (and many more) we were able to put on a great event in one of the nicest rooms we'd ever been in.

Additionally, application architect, Leonard Richardson, will present <i>Project Gutten books are real books</i> - Synopsis: Although Project Gutenberg provides a good amount of RDF metadata for each of its publications, the metadata most necessary to grab a modern reader’s attention–a summary and a nice-looking cover–is almost always missing. Without putting restrictions on Project Gutenberg, which is extraordinarily successful at what it does, how can we present its results in a way that appeals to our patrons and customers?

					<p>
					New York Public Library (NYPL) will use its grant to collect and analyze data on user experiences; identify opportunities for improvements; and design, test, and employ new tools, which will be made available to other libraries. The project addresses the need for evolving access as technology changes. The rapid transformation brought on by the electronic information age has a created a critical moment in which libraries across the country must find ways to ensure democratic access to books, ideas, and information, regardless of format. The project will be supported by a large group of partner libraries and technical advisors and is aligned with the Readers First movement, which is dedicated to ensuring that library patrons have access to both virtual and physical collections. NYPL will test innovative library policies and practices while adopting new technologies in order to create improved patron experiences, with the goals of building new audiences and increasing the use of electronic collections.
